#inheritance
You don’t always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class
you’re writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can
use inheritance. When one class inherits from another, it automatically takes
on all the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is
called the parent class, and the new class is the child class. The child class
inherits every attribute and method from its parent class but is also free to
define new attributes and methods of its own.
